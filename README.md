# Beauty-Disposable-Income-Analytics
The data was cleaned, standardized, and analyzed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) in Jupyter Notebook. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and multiple visualizations including scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and pie charts were performed to identify patterns in pricing, category distribution, country-level ratings, and income relationships
The analysis reveals that the global beauty market is diversified and relatively stable across different countries. Average product ratings remain consistent internationally, suggesting standardized quality and global consumer expectations.

The price distribution indicates that most beauty products fall within a mid-range pricing segment, highlighting affordability as a key market strategy. Furthermore, the scatter plot analysis suggests that disposable income does not strongly influence beauty product ratings, implying that consumer satisfaction may depend more on product quality and brand perception than income level alone.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics techniques can be used to extract meaningful business insights from real-world datasets. The findings can support strategic decisions in pricing, product diversification, and international market positioning within the beauty industr
